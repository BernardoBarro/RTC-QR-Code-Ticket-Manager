# Description
It is a flutter project application to serve as a check-in at places and events

# How it works
Only the event organizers have access to the app, they then register a visitor for the event by adding their data, and then a QR-Code is generated which is sent directly to the registered visitor.

So, when entering, the visitor simply presents their QR-Code and the organizers will read the QR-Code with the application, allowing the visitor to check in.

For paid events, the application is also used to check whether the visitor has already paid or needs to pay.
